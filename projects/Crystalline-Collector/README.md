DESCRIPTION:
Crystalline Collector is, as it sounds a game about collecting crystals, except both you and your opposing player both want the crystals, whether it be for living a life of luxury, building or buying a planet, or just being the greatest crystalline collector of all time, you want those crystals. If you want them, though, you'll have to take them for yourself. 
	
GODSPEED.
